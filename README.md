# Common Gateway Model for Converting Pharmaceutical Forms (Web Interface)

XML is used as a common gateway for file conversion between pharmacies.
This system uses a universal template such that all pharmacies can retain their own original forms while being able to read the forms sent to them by other pharmacies.
After files are converted, they are verified before being sent.
