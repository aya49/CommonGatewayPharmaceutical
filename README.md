# Common Gateway Model for Converting Pharmaceutical Forms (Web Interface)

XML is used as a common gateway for file conversion between pharmacies.
This system uses a universal template such that all pharmacies can retain their own original forms while being able to read the forms sent to them by other pharmacies.
After files are converted, they are verified before being sent.

## Demo
+ [index.html](http://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/aya49/CommonGatewayPharmaceutical-project/blob/master/demo/index.html) is the interface that allows users to perform XML conversion.
+ [XML](./XML) contains example input data to test the system.
+ [XSD](./XSD) contains rules used to verify the XMLs.
+ [db_interaction.png](./db_interaction.png) is the interaction diagram that describes the human computer interaction between the user and the web interface.
+ [ERD.png](./ERD.png) is the ERD (Entity Relationship Diagram) that displays the design of the database.
